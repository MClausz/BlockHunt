## Introduction
Hide and seek is a popular game mode on Minecraft that allows you to hide as blocks and disguise as normal props from seekers. This plugin allows you to do that but with a lot more features added on such as: shops, stats etc...

This plugin has been heavily inspired from the gamemode "PropHunt", from the game, "Garry's Mod".
